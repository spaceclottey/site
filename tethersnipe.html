A manager of a dying arcade takes intitiative to follow her moral convictions admist the recession. A jaded entomologist clocks in after committing academic fraud for breakfast. A listless teenager suffocated by boredom has nothing better to do. 
<br>
They play a game that hasn't been touched for a very, very long time. 
<br>
Fall semester can't come soon enough... if it comes at all. 
<br>
Can you make all the write choices? Or will you ensnare the characters in a web of tangled truths? 
<br>
Tethersnipe is an interactive theater experience created in collaboration with Dooleys Players.
