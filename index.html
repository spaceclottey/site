I begged and begged of him to release this domain to me once I came of age to want such things. Apon understanding the depth of my request my father did his best to help me; he no longer needed the domain, see. Like many, this domain too was a thing of his youth. He went on to goDaddy and tried to release the domain to me, but alas he did not have his own details. And while the years waxed onward and I grew old and grey, I would spend the days and nights pouring over as many variations of the .space domain I could, desperate to find a replacement that would not offend even those with the most illiterate of tech sensibilities. I settled on the unfortunately named spacelutt.com and left it at that. Shortly afterwards, the website you see here was attatcked by chinese hackers, and covered in innapropriate photos it was. Why, you ask? Eludes me. And as our tale drags closer to the present day, I keep checking porkbun, desperate for the day it could return to me...................................................And then...................................................................................It did............................................................................................The world is finally mine. You ain't seeing where this one's going.
